# Public Domain Corpus Data for Uralic Languages, v. 0.1.0

This is an R data package that contains text corpus data from Uralic languages which are in the Public Domain. Individual subsets of the data are documented within the package.

This package is in an extremely early testing stage and it is not yet supposed to be used in actual research. Currently there is data only from Komi-Zyrian, and the whole setup is experimental. But in the near future we intend to provide more data from additional languages and explicit documentation how to use and cite the whole data set or individual resources.

# Citation

Please notice that providing proper references to the sources used is clearly demanded by good scientific practice, even when using Public Domain data. The difference between Public Domain data and virtually any other data source is that the citation is not demanded from a legal perspective, and can be justified and rationalized by what is reasonable.

Explanations how to cite single example sentences or larger subsets of the data are coming soon.
